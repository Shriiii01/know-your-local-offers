# Kolhapur Jewelry Shops Scraping Project

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project was created to scrape jewelry shop data from Justdial for Kolhapur, Maharashtra. Due to Justdial's strong anti-bot protection, we implemented multiple approaches to collect comprehensive business data.

## 📊 Final Results

**Successfully collected data for 20 jewelry shops in Kolhapur** including:
- Shop names
- Complete addresses with pin codes
- Phone numbers (landline and mobile)
- Opening hours
- Ratings
- Websites
- Business categories

with_website = df[df['website'].notna()]

# Shops in specific area
mahadwar_shops = df[df['address'].str.contains('Mahadwar', case=False)]
```

### 3. Export for other applications
```python
# Export to JSON
df.to_json('jewelry_shops.json', orient='records')

# Export specific columns
df[['name', 'phone', 'address']].to_csv('contact_list.csv')
```
